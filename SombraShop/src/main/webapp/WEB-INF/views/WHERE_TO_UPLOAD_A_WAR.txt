Please upload Java apps (WAR files) to a appserver specific deployment directory under ~/appservers directory.
These are:
For Tomcat    - ~/appservers/apache-tomcat-X.X.X/webapps
For Jetty     - ~/appservers/jetty-X.X.X/webapps
For JBoss     - ~/appservers/jboss-as-X.X.X/standalone/deployments
For Glassfish - ~/appservers/glassfish-X.X.X/glassfish/domains/domain1/applications

~ is your home directory /home/username.

By default all requests are mapped to appserver (nothing is read from public_html by webserver).

public_html is only for non-Java apps like static HTML, PHP, Python, Perl.
If you want to place something in public_html you need to unmap the URL from being passed to appserver.
Login to Java Control Panel and find mapping tutorial in Mapping section.

Happy hosting!
